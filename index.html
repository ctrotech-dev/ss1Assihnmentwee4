        { id: 15, question: "How do you calculate the total displacement in a given motion?", hint: "It’s the straight-line distance between start and end points.", answer: "Displacement is calculated by finding the straight-line distance and direction between the initial and final position." },
        { id: 16, question: "Explain the term 'velocity-time graph' and what it represents.", hint: "Think of the graph showing the object's speed over time.", answer: "A velocity-time graph represents how the velocity of an object changes over time, with the slope representing acceleration." },
        { id: 17, question: "What is the area under a velocity-time graph?", hint: "It represents something related to distance.", answer: "The area under a velocity-time graph represents the displacement of the object." },
        { id: 18, question: "What are the main factors that affect acceleration?", hint: "Think about forces and mass.", answer: "Acceleration is affected by the force acting on an object and its mass, as described by Newton’s second law (F = ma)." },
        { id: 19, question: "What is the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity?", hint: "One is over time, the other at a point.", answer: "Average velocity is calculated over a period of time, while instantaneous velocity is the velocity at a specific moment." },
        { id: 20, question: "What does a negative acceleration indicate?", hint: "It’s related to the speed slowing down.", answer: "Negative acceleration indicates that the object is slowing down, or decelerating." }
